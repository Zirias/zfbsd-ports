Spindle is an integrated linking, loading and crunching solution for C64
trackmos. By hiding the details of the storage model, it allows the demo coder
to focus on effects, transitions and flow.

The core of Spindle is a cutting-edge IRQ loader featuring extremely fast
scattered loading and decrunching, state of the art serial transfer routines
and GCR decoding on the fly. On top of this, Spindle provides an optional
linking framework that automates much of the tedious work traditionally
associated with trackmo development.
