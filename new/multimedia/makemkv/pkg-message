This port doesn't include the MakeMKV GUI as it doesn't work on FreeBSD.

Basic console usage:

# makemkvcon info disc:0
show information about the disc in the first drive

# makemkvcon mkv disc:0 0 .
copy title 0 from disc in the first drive to the current directory

For more information, please refer to
<https://www.makemkv.com/developers/usage.txt>.

The port is built using FreeBSD headers together with Linux libraries, so it
might break any time.

To enable makemkvcon to find a drive on FreeBSD, a part of Linux' sysfs must
be faked. The included script `update-makemkv-drives' creates these faked
sysfs entries and is run automatically after installation. If your hardware
configuration changes, make sure to re-run `update-makemkv-drives'.
