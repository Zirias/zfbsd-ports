# zfbsd-ports

Zirias' FreeBSD ports tree. This tree contains ports I'm working on in the
branch `local`. This branch is regularly rebased onto `main` which contains
the original upstream ports (from https://git.freebsd.org/ports.git)

**Note:** This means if you want to track my `local` branch, you'll have to
force-update your tracking branch all the time. If you're interested in using
one commit from here that's not yet upstream (or maybe never will be), I
recommend you cherry-pick it into your own local branch.
